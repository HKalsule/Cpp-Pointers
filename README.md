# 📌 C++ Pointer Programs Collection

### 👨‍💻 Developed by Hardik Kalsule

This project contains multiple small C++ programs focused on understanding and demonstrating the use of **pointers**, **memory addresses**, **pointer arithmetic**, and **value swapping techniques**.

## 🧾 Descriptions of Programs

### 1. **Pointer Basics**
- Shows how to declare and use pointers.
- Prints values, addresses, and demonstrates dereferencing.
- Includes both integer and float pointer examples.

### 2. **Pointers with Arrays**
- Demonstrates pointer arithmetic.
- Uses a pointer to traverse and print the contents of an integer array.

### 3. **Swapping Using Pointers**
- Swaps the values of two variables using a pointer-based function (pass-by-address).
- Effectively modifies the original variables.

### 4. **Swapping Using Pass-by-Value (Incorrect Method)**
- Attempts to swap two integers using a function that receives arguments by value.
- Illustrates why values don’t change outside the function.

### 5. **Swapping Pointer Addresses (Advanced Case)**
- Attempts to swap the addresses stored in two pointer variables.
- Highlights that simply passing pointers won’t change what the original pointers point to (unless done via pointer-to-pointer or reference to pointer).

## ✅ Concepts Demonstrated

- Pointer declaration and initialization  
- Address-of (`&`) and dereference (`*`) operators  
- Pointer arithmetic and array traversal  
- Function calls: pass-by-value vs pass-by-pointer  
- Memory address manipulation and common mistakes
